This project aims to analyze the San Francisco County region's data based on five key factors: Education, Resident Population, Median Income, Median House Prices, and Poverty. The data is collected and merged on zip codes to calculate a composite score for each region. These scores are then visualized on an interactive dashboard, allowing for region-specific insights. The dashboard uses a color-coded map to filter and visualize data based on zip code performance, categorizing the regions as Good, Average, or Below Average based on their composite scores.

The goal of this project is to:
Analyze regional data using key socio-economic factors.
Calculate a composite score for each zip code by assigning weights to five factors.
Create an interactive dashboard to visualize and explore these data, with a map that color-codes regions based on their composite scores.
Filter and analyze individual regions based on user interaction with the dashboard.
